# X-Team 111 Project Proposal: Money Tree

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

Briefly describe a problem that your team would like to solve.  
Describe at a high level a program that could solve that problem.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)
Money Tree


2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  Include and example format of the output produced.

The user inputs a category of their expenditures they would like to look at. The program produces a pie graph of what the user spent in the last month. For instance if the category is food, each slice of the pie graph is an individual foot item the user has purchased. In addition, the user has the option to be shown a line graph of their purchases over time.  



3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.
We need data for each expenditure, which can be obtained either by asking the users to manually put in the transaction, or by pulling the data through the API of the bank.

- Example: 
- Payee: Wiscard
- Amount: $5000
- Category: Food
- Date: 10/29/2017




4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.



5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
