# X-Team 111 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Team leader assigns tasks with the advice and consent of each of the team members. Team members suggest what they would like to do and the 
team leader takes that into consideration. 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will meet on a weekly basis and collaberate with each other to ensure that we are all on track and completing what is 
nessecary. We also will create a rough scheduele of what is needed to complete the project on time. 


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will keep in touch using text messaging. If needed the group can decide how to re-prioritize the tasks the group works on. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Task auditing. Everyone will be assigned a task, but everyone will also be assigned to make sure that at least one other group member finishes their respective task.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Make sure that everyone knows when the deadlines are and we will remind eachother of them. 
Every team member should give a heads up if they are not able to complete a task on time, with at least a 24 hour notice
All arguements should be resolved by democratic vote. if a tie, team leader decides course of action.
